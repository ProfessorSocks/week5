     * pillars of OOP:
     * 1. Abstraction
     *   - Hiding unnecessary details
     *   - Only showing what is needed
     * 2. Encapsulation
     *   - Only letting certain areas of the code be accessable
     *   - User doesn't need to know how code works just that it runs
     * 3. Inheritance
     *   - Can inherit from parent classes/objects
     * 4. Polymorphism
     *   - Classes can take different forms
     *   - Animal class can be called into a dog or a cat subclass. dog class may bark and cat class may meow
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * class - how we structure our code in OOP
     * class is a blueprint
     * 
     * object is product developed from blueprint/class
     * An object is an instance of a class!!!!!!
